# calculator tester
A program that generates equations to then test against my basic string-input calculator and python's eval() function

To run you need to download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads

Only the calculatorTester.py needs to be downloaded. Once downloaded, open a command prompt and change to the directory to wherever the calculator.py file is located. Then enter "python calculator.py" to run.
