# calculator tester
A program that randomly generates equations to then test against my basic string-input calculator and python's eval() function. Requires [my python calculator](https://github.com/sharktrexer/calculator) to run.

You also need to download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads

Once both calculator.py and calculatorTeser.py are downloaded, make sure they are both in the same file directory. Open a command prompt and change to the directory to wherever the python files are located. Then enter "python calculatorTester.py" to run.

Example:
