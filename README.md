# calculator tester
A program that randomly generates equations to then test against my basic string-input calculator and python's eval() function. Contains a slightly modified version of my calculator, so no additional downloads are necessary.

To run you need to download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads

Only the calculatorTester.py needs to be downloaded. Once downloaded, open a command prompt and change to the directory to wherever the calculatorTester.py file is located. Then enter "python calculatorTester.py" to run.

To use my calculator to solve equations you can input: https://github.com/sharktrexer/calculator
